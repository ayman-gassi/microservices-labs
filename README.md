# Microservices Workspace

This workspace contains multiple Spring Boot microservices built with Maven. Each service is an independent project with its own Maven Wrapper, source code, and configuration.

## Projects

- `1-service-product` — Product service (entities, DTOs, mapper, repository, service layer)
- `2-TP_com/TP_com_Etudiant` — Etudiant (Student) service (controller, DTOs, mapper, repository, service)
- `2-TP_com/TP_com_Filiere` — Filiere (Program) service (controller, DTOs, mapper, repository, service)

## Prerequisites

- Java (JDK) installed and on PATH
- Git (optional)

Note: Maven Wrappers are included, so you don't need Maven installed globally.
